#### Your Solution
We call it Spave!
Yes, from Spend and Save.
Our plaform is an online finance budgeting platform.
The two major things on our platform are:<br/><br/>
<b>Spend</b>: You can create an automated transaction based on a cycle you specify. This helps you to avoid reckless and unplanned-for spending.
Take for example, you earn 100,000 naira per month, you wanted to pay<br/>
a. 10,000 naira to your church as tithe<br/>
b. 20,000 niara to your parents<br/>
c. 4,000 naira for foodstuffs every week<br/>
d. 20,000 to your child's savings account<br/>

You can automate all these expenses without the fear of forgetting or stressing yourslef every week and month.
This system also helps you to prevent extravagance on already budgeted money.

<b>Save</b>: You can create savings card where you can save towards a goal based on a specified cycle.
Take for example, you earn 135,000 naira a month, and you want to:<br/>
a. buy a Sportsbike for 1.2 million naira<br/>
b. save towards your wedding anniversary ceremony.<br/>
You can create Savings cards to deduct these amounts per week, month or any number of days.
This system helps you cultivate a good saving habit, because most of time, we end up spending saved money on irrelevnaces.

Our platform helps you create a balance between your expenditures and savings.<br/>
